          <p>The sled push (aka prowler press) is a functional full-body
            exercise that targets your quads, glutes, hip flexors, calves,
            hamstrings, core, triceps, chest, and shoulders. Depending on your
            goals, you can push the sled with minimal weight for a longer
            duration or stack on the resistance and push for a shorter distance.</p>

          <h2><b>Sled Push to Plank</b></h2>
          <p>How to: Load a sled up with an adequate amount of weight Staying
            low and in a good athletic position (chest up, back flat, core
            engaged), push the sled as fast as you can for 30 seconds
            Immediately drop down to the ground and hold a Front Plank (never
            hit your knees) for 45 seconds That’s 1 round Repeat that sequence
            for 5 rounds</p>

        <div class="content">
          <p>The bent over lateral raise directly hits the rear deltoids
            (Shoulders). Considered an isolation exercise, it also exercises the
            trapezius muscles, which are considered secondary muscles. This
            exercise also hits the side deltoids as well.</p>

            <li>In a seated position with your feet firmly planted on the floor,
              grasp two dumbbells with both hands.</li>
            <li>Bend over until your body is roughly parallel to the ground or
              slightly above. Your chest should almost be touching your thighs.</li>
            <li>In a controlled fashion, raise the dumbbells with both hands
              using your shoulders, out and away from the body. You should raise
              the dumbbells to each side until they are parallel with the upper
              back.</li>
            <li>Pause for a moment and slowly lower the weight to the initial
              position.</li>

        <p class="title">Dead Lifts</p>
        <div class="content">
          <p>Deadlifting is a fairly basic movement, but it’s one that poses
            lots of risk to your back if done incorrectly. Here’s a step-by-step
            guide on how to deadlift. With the barbell on the floor, stand with
            your feet shoulder width apart and your toes just under the bar.
            Bend at the legs and keep your back in a straight line. Grip the bar
            with either an overhand grip (palms facing back towards your body)
            or a mixed grip (one hand over, one hand facing out.) Keep your head
            up and your back straight as you drive through your legs, with your
            chest pointing up. Fully extend your legs and pull the bar up. It
            should rise near your shins and pass over your knees as you
            straighten your legs and press your hips forward. You should end up
            standing straight with the barbell held at waist height. Again, make
            sure to keep your back straight. Place the bar back down by bending
            your legs and keeping your back straight, taking care to keep your
            head up.</p>
