When created the workout then will allow users to comment on it to share their thoughts and inspirations, or they can favorite a workout which allows them to save it for later and come back to it whenever they want.

### **Features**

This app was developed using the MVC model. It uses mySQL and Sequelize to create the models. The control is built using NodeJS and Express packages. And views are created using Handlebars, HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Authentication for the site uses express-session and bcrypt, this allows us to keep track of user sessions when they log into the app as well as allows a way for us to hash their passwords for the site.

## **Install**

Please use **'npm i'** in the command line to install the dependencies.

Before you begin please also update the **'.env.EXAMPLE'** file to include your information for SQL. Then rename the file to **'.env'**. Without the app will not be able to access the database properly.

Please then use in the MySQL terminal **'source db/schema.sql;'**, this will create the database.

Also in the powershell terminal use **'npm run seed'**, this will seed the database with data.

## **Usage**
When ready use **'npm start'** into the terminal to launch the app.
